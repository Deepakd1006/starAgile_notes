1) how in ansibel the public key is stored in the clint system for more security ? why ?
-> In Ansible, when setting up passwordless SSH authentication between the control node (Ansible server) and managed nodes (clients), the public key is stored on the 
client system inside the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file. This ensures that only authorized Ansible control nodes can connect securely.

2) that means having a public key, the Clients node can not connect to the ansible controler node ? am I right ? 
--> Yes, You Are Right! ðŸš€
Having just the public key on the client node does NOT allow the client to connect to the Ansible controller. Here's why:

Public Key on the Client â†’ No Access to Ansible Controller
In SSH key authentication, the public key is placed on the target system (client) inside ~/.ssh/authorized_keys.
The private key remains on the Ansible controller and is never shared.
Only the private key can authenticate to the public key.
So, the client node cannot connect to the Ansible controller because it does not have the private key!

3) what if i also have private key in my client node ? can I connect ?
Yes, If You Have the Private Key in the Client Node, You Can Connect! ðŸš€
If the private key is also present on the client node, then the client can authenticate and connect to the Ansible controller 
(if the controller allows SSH connections and has the matching public key in its ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file).

4) so now only the clint can connect to the controler node am I right ?
Yes, You Are Right! âœ…
In your current setup:

Ansible Controller â†’ Has only the private key (id_rsa)
Client Node â†’ Has both the private key and public key (id_rsa & id_rsa.pub)
ðŸ”¹ Result: The client can SSH into the controller, but the controller cannot SSH into the client.
